# Data::Properties -- Flexible properties handling

A flexible properties mechanism modelled after the Java implementation
of properties.

In general, a property is a string value that is associated with a
key. A key is a series of names (identifiers) separated with periods.
Names are treated case insensitive. Unlike in Java, the properties are
really hierarchically organized. This means that for a given property
you can fetch the list of its subkeys, and so on. Moreover, the list
of subkeys is returned in the order the properties were defined.

Data::Properties can also be used to define data structures, just like
JSON but with much less quotes.

## Example of Usage

    use Data::Properties;

    my $cfg = new Data::Properties;

    # Preset a property.
    $cfg->set_property("config.version", "1.23");

    # Parse a properties file.
    $cfg->parse_file("config.prp");

    # Get a property value
    $version = $cfg->get_property("config.version");
    # Same, but with a default value.
    $version = $cfg->get_property("config.version", "1.23");

    # Get the list of subkeys for a property, and process them.
    my $aref = $cfg->get_property_keys("item.list");
    foreach my $item ( @$aref ) {
        if ( $cfg->get_property("item.list.$item") ) {
            ....
        }
    }

## Example of a Properties file

    config.version: 1.23
	title: "An example"
	database {
	  name: demo
	  host: dbserver.example.com
	  port: 1313
	  type: postgres
    }

The last couple of lines show a short form of writing `database.name`,
`database.host` and so on.

## Design goals

* properties must be hierarchical of unlimited depth;

* manual editing of the property files (hence unambiguous syntax and
  lay out);

* it must be possible to locate all subkeys of a property in the order
  they appear in the property file(s);

* lightweight so shell scripts can use it to query properties.
